              UX refers to the value that you offer to your users when they are
              using your product. It primarily depends on enhancing user
              satisfaction by improving the accessibility, usability and
              convenience when a user interacts with your product.
            </p>
            <p class="text-[20px] mb-5">
              A well-executed UX process requires you to follow a user-centric
              approach and a defined strategy that enables you to develop
              simple, engaging and intuitive experiences to wow the end-users.
            </p>
            <p class="text-[20px] mb-5">
              Additionally, a meaningful user experience allows you to define
              customer journeys on your product that are most conducive to
              business success.

          <p class="text-[20px] max-w-4xl">
            Before starting anything, we work with the client to find out the
            brand’s mission and goals. It involves performing a detailed review
            of competitors’ websites, along with conducting user testing to
            better understand the larger competitive landscape of the business.

          <p class="font-semibold text-[48px] mb-5">2. Research</p>
          <p class="text-[20px] max-w-4xl">
            Conducting thorough research is the second most integral aspect of
            the UX design process. Research is primarily done to understand more
            about the users, their goals, behaviors, motivations, and needs.
            Good research informs design decisions that will lays the foundation
            of the entire project and can save a lot of time and money down the
            road.

          <p class="text-[20px] max-w-4xl">
            Now its time to analyze the users who are going to use this product.
            Before starting main design process its important creating user
            personas, user stories and user journey map to create a strong
            foundation to design better.

          <p class="font-semibold text-[48px] mb-5">4. Design</p>
          <p class="text-[20px] max-w-4xl mb-5">
            The design process is collaborative – that involves input and ideas
            from various stakeholders and iterative, and validates ideas and
            assumptions.
          </p>
          <p class="text-[20px] max-w-4xl">
            We start with sketching - the easiest and fastest way to visualize
            our ideas. Then we create wireframes, sitemap, userflow, mockups
            (low & low) fidelity , images, icons and colors and a whole design
            system so the product stays consistent throught the process.

          <p class="font-semibold text-[48px] mb-5">5. Prototype</p>
          <p class="text-[20px] max-w-4xl mb-5">
            It’s time implement those High fidelity mockups into actions, this
            is where prototyping comes in. Prototypes concentrate on the feel of
            the UI/UX product that one is designing. It’s more about the
            interaction experience. Prototypes give you the effect of a
            simulator.</p> 
            <p class="text-[20px] max-w-4xl mb-5">Once its approved and we pass everything to the
            development team who will create a high fidelity version of the user
            interface into coded prototypes.</p> 
            <p class="text-[20px] max-w-4xl">During the development, we use user
            testing (targeted users), beta launch( limited release of the
            product) and internal testing so that users can test out the product
            and give & recieve feedback so the the development team updates the
            products accordingly before it launches.</p>
